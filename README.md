# How to use? 

Basically you can run all the code with one comment.
```
docker compose up -d
```

# Problems faced
Sadly becaouse I am currently imrpoving myself at system engineering and devops, I had hard time to understand how the helm package was working. I put some notes that you can see what I was trying to do. But sadly I failed to do all of it.

# The plan if I had time
## Dockerization
Happly I was able to configure the dockerization of the program itself. But I worked with docker at my previous experiences, So it was not too hard.
## Kubernets and helm integration. 
I wanted to integrate the kubernets and manage the packages with helm and use kubernetes via minikube. But it failed so i did not have any chance to apply other tasks. But I had plan for them.
## CD/ID Secret variables and dynamic database change.
So for the CD/ID and secret varialbes, I was planning to do with github workflow. Its usefull for the secret variables maganment (enviorment variable) and creating CD/ID pipelines. With rule of restarting the back-end with the change of the database variables I planned to apply the dynamic database change.
## Results and last words
Becaouse of my lack of experience at kubernetes, I was not able to finish the project. I was dealing with my grandfathers health issues and a friend from NATO (a biritsh friend visited Turkey Ankara.) I just want a chance at your beatifull company and i know i can do better. If possible, gave me chance at the techichal interwiew. 

Again sory for late delivery and problems. 

Best regards.
